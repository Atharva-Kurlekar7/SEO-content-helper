# YouTube SEO Helper


A sophisticated tool to help content creators optimize their YouTube videos for better visibility and engagement.

## Overview

YouTube SEO Helper is a web application that analyzes YouTube video metadata and provides actionable recommendations to improve search engine optimization. The tool implements advanced generative AI techniques including Prompt Engineering and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) to deliver customized SEO advice.

## Features

- **Title Analysis**: Get specific recommendations to improve your video titles with keyword placement, length optimization, and engagement factors.
- **Description Enhancement**: Optimize your descriptions with strategic keyword placement, improved readability, and suggestions for timestamps, links, and calls-to-action.
- **Tag Optimization**: Receive tailored tag suggestions to improve discoverability with the right mix of broad and specific keywords.
- **Dual Input Options**: Analyze existing videos by URL or optimize content before publishing by entering title, description, and tags manually.
- **AI-Powered Recommendations**: Leverage advanced AI techniques for personalized optimization advice.
- **Fallback Mechanisms**: Ensure reliable operation with rule-based analysis when API access is limited.
