  - Specific Tag Example: "Fine-tuning GPT-4 with PEFT", "Midjourney V6 Image Upscaling Tutorial"
- Add **multi-word long-tail phrases** people naturally search:
  - Examples: "how to train AI models", "prompt engineering for beginners", "free AI art tools"
- Include **common misspellings** and variations where appropriate:
  - Example: "Chat GPT4", "Midjourny", "DallE image generation"
- Use tags that connect to user intent:
