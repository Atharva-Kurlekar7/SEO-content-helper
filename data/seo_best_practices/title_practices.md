# YouTube Title SEO Best Practices for AI and Tutorial Videos

## Length and Format

- Keep titles between **55-70 characters** to ensure full visibility on desktop, mobile, and TV screens.
- Always **prioritize the first 45 characters** — they are the most visible across mobile devices and YouTube thumbnails.
- Use numbers naturally to indicate value:
  - Examples: "5 Secrets to Fine-Tune GPT-4", "Top 7 Free AI Tools for 2025"
- Include the **current year** for tutorials and AI tools videos to emphasize relevance:
  - Examples: "Prompt Engineering Guide 2025", "Top Midjourney Prompts [2025 Updated]"
- For AI model videos, **include model versions** directly in the title:
  - "Llama-3 Fine-Tuning Tutorial" > "Fine-Tuning Tutorial"
- If making a series:
  - Consistent part labeling is critical (e.g., "Part 1 of 5", "Module 1: Basics of Prompt Engineering")
  - Helps with binge-watching behavior for educational tutorials.
- Use clear separators:
  - Good: "GPT-4 Tutorial for Beginners - Full Walkthrough"
  - Bad: "GPT4tutorial#beginner#ai"
- Avoid stuffing multiple brackets or parentheses — keep it clean.
- **Title Tone**: Be professional and credible if it's a tutorial; slightly playful and emotional if it's a tool showcase.

### Bonus Tip:
- If possible, **test your title visibility** by simulating mobile view before publishing using browser dev tools (F12 > Toggle Device Toolbar).

## Keyword Optimization

- **Primary Keyword in the First 3 Words**:
  - If your keyword is "Fine-tuning GPT-4", start your title with it: "Fine-tuning GPT-4 Models: Step-by-Step Tutorial".
- **Use Compound Keywords** smartly:
  - Example: "How to Fine-tune GPT-4 | Beginner to Expert" — covers "fine-tune GPT-4" and "beginner to expert" search intents.
- Use **natural search queries** — think about what *humans* type, not what looks good to you:
  - Bad: "Deep GPT-4 Hacks Analysis"
  - Good: "How to Use GPT-4 to Build Apps (No Coding Required)"
- **Keyword Tools** you should actively use:
  - **VidIQ**: keyword inspector, competition score
  - **TubeBuddy**: keyword scorecard, tag explorer
  - **Ahrefs YouTube Keyword Tool**: bigger picture of keyword demand
  - **Google Trends**: filter to "YouTube Search" mode
- **Keyword Placement Strategy**:
  - Primary Keyword → First 3 words
  - Secondary Supporting Keywords → After separator (| or -)
- Use **high-probability phrases** that relate to AI like:
  - "how to fine-tune", "prompt engineering", "train AI models", "best AI tools", "open-source AI alternatives", "AI productivity hacks"

### Bonus Tip:
- **Refresh keywords quarterly**: AI is a fast-moving niche. Titles that ranked 6 months ago might underperform today without updating.

## Engagement Factors

- **Create Curiosity Without Misleading**:
  - Good: "The Secret Sauce Behind Midjourney v6 Prompts" → implies mystery but satisfies after clicking.
  - Bad: "You Won't Believe What Happens With GPT-4!" → classic clickbait — punished by YouTube.
- **Emotional Drivers**:
  - Incorporate emotion subtly:
    - "Underrated AI Tools That Will Change Your Career"
    - "Shocking Midjourney Hacks They Don't Tell You"
- **Value-First Framing**:
  - Tell users **what THEY get**, not what YOU made:
    - Bad: "My GPT-4 Project Journey"
    - Good: "How to Build GPT-4 Projects in Less Than a Day"
- **Power Words** that attract more clicks:
  - Secrets, Masterclass, Complete Guide, Proven, Powerful, Hidden, Breakthrough, Next-Gen, Foolproof
- **Avoid Overpromising**:
  - Promise a realistic result — tutorials and educational videos thrive on trust.

### Bonus Tip:
- **Test titles by asking**: If I had zero context, would this make me *want* to click to *learn* something new?
